## Success Story Example

**Company:** CloudTech Solutions, Enterprise Software Provider

**Challenge:** CloudTech's sales team spent hours creating custom pitch decks for each enterprise prospect, but only 35% of prospects reviewed the materials. Sales cycles averaged 95 days, and reps struggled to engage multiple stakeholders within buying committees. They were losing deals to competitors who provided better information access and responsiveness.

Each prospect received a personalized capsule link that they could explore and share with colleagues. The AI answered questions about features, pricing, integration, and implementation.

**Results:**
