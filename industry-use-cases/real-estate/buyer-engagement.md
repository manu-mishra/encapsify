## Best Practices

1. **Stage Content Appropriately**: Deliver information based on buyer's journey stage (awareness, consideration, decision)
2. **Capture Preferences Early**: Use interactive forms to gather buyer requirements, budget, and timeline upfront
3. **Provide Market Context**: Include relevant market data and trends for buyer's target areas
4. **Enable Self-Service**: Let buyers explore neighborhoods, schools, and amenities at their own pace
5. **Set Clear Expectations**: Use capsule to communicate your process, timeline, and what buyers should expect
6. **Maintain Personal Touch**: Balance AI automation with personal video messages and check-ins
7. **Update Market Information**: Keep market data, inventory levels, and interest rate information current
8. **Celebrate Milestones**: Acknowledge buyer progress through the journey (pre-approval, first showing, offer accepted)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Information Overload**: Providing too much information at once instead of staging content appropriately
- **Generic Content**: Using the same capsule for first-time buyers and experienced investors
- **Neglecting Follow-Up**: Relying solely on the capsule without personal agent engagement
- **Outdated Market Data**: Failing to update market statistics and inventory information regularly
- **Ignoring Engagement Signals**: Not acting on buyer readiness indicators shown in analytics
