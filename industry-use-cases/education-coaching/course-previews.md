## Success Story Example

**Educator:** Marcus Chen, Professional Development Coach & Course Creator

**Challenge:** Marcus offered 8 professional development courses but spent 12-15 hours weekly answering prospect questions about course content, prerequisites, and outcomes. Many students enrolled without fully understanding requirements, leading to dissatisfaction and refund requests. His inquiry-to-enrollment conversion rate was only 14%, and he was losing prospects who browsed his courses outside business hours.

**Implementation:** Marcus created Course Preview Capsules for each course, including course trailers, sample lessons, detailed curriculum breakdowns, prerequisite assessments, and student success stories. Prospects could explore courses, ask questions, assess their readiness, and enroll directly—all through the interactive capsule experience.

**Results:**
- Increased enrollment conversion from 14% to 36%
- Reduced pre-enrollment consultation time from 14 hours to 2.5 hours per week
- Improved student course-fit rate from 65% to 94%
- Decreased refund requests by 78%
- Captured 68% of course exploration occurring outside business hours
- Enrolled 47 additional students in first quarter

**Quote:** "Course Preview Capsules have transformed how I market and sell my courses. Prospects can now explore everything they need to know on their own time, and I only spend time with students who are genuinely ready to enroll. My students are better prepared, more satisfied, and my business has grown significantly."
