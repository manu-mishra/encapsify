## Structure Validation Checklist

### Universal Checks
- [ ] Document has single H1 title
- [ ] Overview/introduction section present
- [ ] Logical section organization
- [ ] No orphaned content (all content under appropriate headings)
- [ ] Related documentation links included (if applicable)

### Features Domain Checks

- [ ] Technical requirements specified
- [ ] Dependencies identified (if any)

### Business Plan Domain Checks
- [ ] Executive summary or overview present
- [ ] Key takeaways or conclusions included

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Identify Document Type
Determine which domain and document type to validate against:
- Features: Core domain feature, user profile, or cross-cutting concern
- Business Plan: Strategic document, playbook, or governance document
- Industry Use Cases: Use case scenario or template

### Step 2: Check Required Sections
Verify all required sections for that document type are present:
- Use domain-specific structure requirements above
- Ensure sections are properly named and formatted
- Confirm content is present in each required section

### Step 3: Validate Content Organization
- Heading hierarchy is logical and complete
- Content flows naturally from section to section
- No duplicate or redundant sections
- All content is under appropriate headings

### Step 4: Verify Cross-References
- Related documentation links are present
- Links point to existing, relevant documents
- Dependencies are properly documented
- Navigation is clear and helpful

### Step 5: Check Completeness
- No placeholder text (e.g., "[TODO]", "[TBD]")
- All sections have substantive content
- Examples and details are sufficient
- Document achieves its stated purpose

## Common Structure Issues

### Issue: Missing Required Sections
**Problem:** Document lacks sections required for its type
**Solution:** Add missing sections using appropriate templates
**Prevention:** Use document templates from `/templates` directory

### Issue: Inconsistent Heading Hierarchy
**Problem:** Headings skip levels or are improperly nested
**Solution:** Reorganize headings to follow logical hierarchy
**Prevention:** Plan document structure before writing

### Issue: Orphaned Content
**Problem:** Content exists outside of any section structure
**Solution:** Move content under appropriate headings
**Prevention:** Always place content under relevant headings

### Issue: Insufficient Cross-Referencing
**Problem:** Document doesn't link to related content
**Solution:** Add "Related Documentation" section with relevant links
**Prevention:** Consider document relationships during creation

## Automated Structure Validation

### Validation Rules
Automated tools can check for:
1. Presence of required sections by document type
2. Heading hierarchy correctness
3. Minimum content length per section
4. Presence of cross-reference sections
5. Placeholder text detection

### Validation Severity Levels

**Critical (Must Fix):**
- Missing required sections
- No H1 heading
- Empty required sections

**Warning (Should Fix):**
- Missing optional but recommended sections
- Very short sections (<50 words)
- No cross-references

**Info (Consider):**
- Additional sections that could enhance document
- Opportunities for better organization
- Suggestions for related content links
