# 🧩 Product Summary — Encaptio / Encapsify

**Encaptio** (or **Encapsify**) is a platform for creating and sharing personalized, multimodal AI capsules — lightweight interactive assistants that can include text, voice, images, videos, and documents, customized by the creator and shareable via a link.

These AI capsules can:
- Answer questions conversationally based on uploaded content
- Present voice or video responses using avatars
- Collect feedback, leads, or insights from recipients
- Be fine-tuned with specific tone, knowledge, and context

Think of it as **"a smart AI microsite in a capsule"**, where anyone — individual or business — can package their expertise, pitch, brand, or message into an interactive AI form.
