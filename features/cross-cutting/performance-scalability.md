# Performance & Scalability

## Overview

Performance & Scalability ensures the Encaptio/Encapsify platform delivers fast, reliable experiences at any scale. This cross-cutting feature encompasses infrastructure optimization, caching strategies, load balancing, and capacity planning.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Fast Loading
**As an** end user  
**I want** capsules to load instantly  
**So that** I can start interacting without waiting

### Story 2: Reliable Performance
**As a** business user  
**I want** consistent performance during high traffic  
**So that** my capsules are always available to prospects

### Story 3: Global Reach
**As an** enterprise user  
**I want** fast performance worldwide  
**So that** our global audience has a great experience

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Support 10,000+ concurrent users per capsule
- Handle 1M+ requests per day
- Scale to 100,000+ capsules
- Global latency: < 100ms (p95)
- Database query time: < 50ms (p95)

## Business Value

Excellent performance drives user engagement, reduces bounce rates, and enables platform growth. Scalability ensures reliability during traffic spikes and supports business expansion.

## Dependencies

- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- CDN service (CloudFront, Cloudflare)
- Caching systems (Redis, Memcached)
- Load balancers
- Monitoring tools (DataDog, New Relic)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a capsule loads THEN it SHALL display within 2 seconds
2. WHEN traffic spikes THEN the system SHALL auto-scale
3. IF a server fails THEN traffic SHALL route to healthy servers
4. WHEN users are global THEN latency SHALL be < 100ms
5. WHERE caching is possible THEN content SHALL be cached
6. WHEN monitoring THEN performance metrics SHALL be tracked

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Optimization

**Frontend Optimization:**
- Code splitting and lazy loading

- Preloading and prefetching
- Service workers for offline

**Backend Optimization:**
- Database query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Efficient algorithms
- Asynchronous processing
- Background jobs
- Batch operations
- API response compression

**Network Optimization:**
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
- Compression (gzip, brotli)
- Keep-alive connections

- Resource hints
- Early hints

### Caching Strategy

**Multi-Layer Caching:**

**1. Browser Cache:**
- Static assets: 1 year
- API responses: Configurable
- Cache-Control headers
- ETags for validation

**2. CDN Cache:**
- Static content: Global distribution
- Dynamic content: Edge caching
- Cache invalidation
- Geo-routing

**3. Application Cache (Redis):**
- Session data
- Frequently accessed data
- API responses
- Computed results
- TTL-based expiration

**4. Database Cache:**
