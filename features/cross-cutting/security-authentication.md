# Security & Authentication

## Overview

Security & Authentication provides comprehensive security controls, user authentication, authorization, and compliance features across the entire Encaptio/Encapsify platform. This cross-cutting feature ensures data protection, secure access, and regulatory compliance.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Secure Access
**As a** platform user  
**I want** secure authentication and authorization  
**So that** my account and data are protected

### Story 2: Data Protection
**As a** business user  
**I want** my content and user data encrypted  
**So that** sensitive information remains confidential

### Story 3: Compliance
**As an** enterprise administrator  
**I want** the platform to meet compliance standards  
**So that** we can use it for regulated data

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Authentication:**
- Email/password authentication
- Social login (Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML 2.0
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Passwordless authentication (magic links)
- Session management
- Token-based authentication (JWT)
- API key authentication

**Authorization:**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Resource-level permissions
- Team/organization hierarchy
- Permission inheritance
- Temporary access grants
- API access controls

**Data Security:**
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Secure key management
- Data anonymization
- PII protection
- Secure file storage

**Compliance:**
- GDPR compliance
- CCPA compliance
- SOC 2 Type II
- HIPAA compliance (healthcare tier)
- ISO 27001
- Regular security audits

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Authentication latency: < 500ms
- 99.99% authentication availability
- Zero-trust architecture
- Regular penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Incident response plan

## Business Value

Robust security builds trust, enables enterprise adoption, ensures regulatory compliance, and protects both platform and user data from threats.

## Dependencies

- Identity provider services
- Encryption services
- Certificate management
- Audit logging system
- Compliance monitoring tools

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN credentials SHALL be validated securely
2. WHEN data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted at rest
3. IF MFA is enabled THEN second factor SHALL be required
4. WHEN accessing resources THEN permissions SHALL be enforced
5. WHERE compliance is required THEN standards SHALL be met
6. WHEN security events occur THEN they SHALL be logged and monitored

## Implementation Notes

### Authentication Methods

**Email/Password:**
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Password strength requirements
- Password reset flow
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Rate limiting

**Social Login:**
- OAuth 2.0 integration
- Supported providers: Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn
- Account linking
- Profile data sync

**SSO (Enterprise):**
- SAML 2.0 support
- Integration with Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin
- Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning
- Attribute mapping
- Single Logout (SLO)

**Multi-Factor Authentication:**
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- SMS codes
- Email codes
- Authenticator apps (Google, Authy)
- Backup codes
- Biometric (mobile apps)

### Authorization Model

**Roles:**
- Owner: Full account control
- Admin: User and settings management
- Editor: Content creation and editing
- Viewer: Read-only access
- Custom roles (Enterprise)

**Permissions:**
- Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) on resources
- Publish/unpublish capsules
- Manage team members
- View analytics
- Manage integrations
- Billing access

**Resource Hierarchy:**
```
Organization
├── Workspace
│   ├── Capsule
│   │   ├── Content
│   │   ├── Analytics
│   │   └── Settings
│   └── Team Members
└── Billing
```

### Data Encryption

**At Rest:**
- Database encryption (AES-256)
- File storage encryption
- Backup encryption
- Key rotation
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for keys

**In Transit:**
- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- Certificate pinning
- Perfect Forward Secrecy
- HSTS headers
- Secure WebSocket connections

**Application-Level:**
- Sensitive field encryption
- PII tokenization
- Secure credential storage
- API key encryption

### Security Headers

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### Compliance Features

**GDPR:**
- Data subject rights (access, deletion, portability)
- Consent management
- Data processing agreements
- Privacy by design
- Data breach notification
- Data Protection Officer (DPO)

**HIPAA (Healthcare):**
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
- PHI encryption
- Access controls
- Audit logging
- Breach notification
- Risk assessments

**SOC 2:**
- Security controls
- Availability monitoring
- Processing integrity
- Confidentiality measures
- Privacy protections

### Audit Logging

**Logged Events:**
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization decisions
- Data access
- Configuration changes
- User management actions
- API calls
- Security events

**Log Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-04T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "authentication",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "action": "login",
  "result": "success",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "metadata": {}
}
```
