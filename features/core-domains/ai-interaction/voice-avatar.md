# Voice & Avatar Interface

## Overview

Voice & Avatar Interface enables AI capsules to communicate through synthesized voice and animated video avatars, creating more engaging and human-like interactions. Users can choose from various voices and avatar styles to match their brand personality.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Voice Response Selection
**As a** capsule creator  
**I want** to select a voice that matches my brand  
**So that** audio responses feel authentic and professional

### Story 2: Avatar Presentation
**As a** real estate agent  
**I want** my capsule to use a professional avatar  
**So that** property presentations feel more personal and trustworthy

### Story 3: Voice-First Interaction
**As a** capsule recipient  
**I want** to hear responses instead of reading them  
**So that** I can multitask while learning about the product

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Support text-to-speech (TTS) for AI responses
- Offer multiple voice options (male, female, various accents)
- Provide animated avatar options (realistic, stylized, abstract)
- Support voice input (speech-to-text) for user questions
- Synchronize avatar lip movements with speech
- Allow voice speed and pitch adjustments
- Support multiple languages for voice output
- Provide text transcript alongside voice/avatar

### Non-Functional Requirements
- TTS latency: < 2 seconds for typical responses
- Voice quality: Natural-sounding, minimal robotic artifacts
- Avatar rendering: 30 FPS minimum for smooth animation
- Lip sync accuracy: 95%+ alignment with speech
- Support 20+ concurrent voice sessions per capsule
- Audio format: MP3 or WebM for broad compatibility

## Business Value

Voice and avatar capabilities create more engaging, memorable experiences that increase time-on-capsule and conversion rates, particularly for industries where personal connection matters (real estate, coaching, sales).

## Dependencies

- Text-to-speech service (ElevenLabs, Azure TTS, or Google TTS)
- Speech-to-text service (Whisper, Google STT, or Azure STT)
- Avatar generation service (D-ID, Synthesia API, or custom)
- Audio streaming infrastructure
- Video encoding and delivery

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a capsule creator selects a voice THEN the system SHALL use that voice for all audio responses
2. WHEN an AI response is generated THEN the system SHALL convert it to speech within 2 seconds
3. IF an avatar is enabled THEN the system SHALL synchronize lip movements with speech
4. WHEN a user speaks a question THEN the system SHALL transcribe it accurately (95%+ accuracy)
5. WHERE multiple languages are supported THEN voice SHALL match the response language
6. WHEN voice is playing THEN the user SHALL have controls to pause, replay, or adjust speed

## Implementation Notes

### Voice Options

**Voice Categories:**
- Professional (business, formal)
- Casual (friendly, conversational)
- Energetic (enthusiastic, upbeat)
- Calm (soothing, measured)

**Voice Attributes:**
- Gender (male, female, neutral)
- Age range (young, middle-aged, mature)
- Accent (American, British, Australian, etc.)
- Language (English, Spanish, French, etc.)

### Avatar Types

**Realistic Avatars:**
- Photorealistic human faces
- Professional attire options
- Customizable backgrounds
- Facial expressions and gestures

**Stylized Avatars:**
- Illustrated characters
- Brand mascots
- Abstract representations
- Animated icons

**Avatar-Free Voice:**
- Voice-only mode with visual waveform
- Text display with audio
- Minimal UI for audio-first experience

### Technical Architecture

1. **Voice Generation Pipeline**
   - AI generates text response
   - Text sent to TTS service
   - Audio file generated and cached
   - Audio streamed to user

2. **Avatar Rendering Pipeline**
   - Text response + selected avatar
   - Avatar service generates video with lip sync
   - Video encoded and cached
   - Video streamed to user

3. **Voice Input Pipeline**
   - User speaks into microphone
   - Audio captured and sent to STT service
   - Text transcription returned
   - Text processed as query

### Performance Optimization
- Pre-generate common responses
- Cache TTS output for repeated phrases
- Use streaming for long responses
- Compress audio/video for faster delivery
- CDN distribution for global performance
