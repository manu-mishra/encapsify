# Contextual Responses

## Overview

Contextual Responses enable AI capsules to provide accurate, relevant answers based on uploaded content using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system retrieves relevant content chunks and generates natural language responses that directly address user questions.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Content-Based Q&A
**As a** capsule recipient  
**I want** to ask questions and receive accurate answers from the capsule's content  
**So that** I can quickly find information without reading entire documents

### Story 2: Source Attribution
**As a** capsule recipient  
**I want** to see which documents or sections the AI used for its answer  
**So that** I can verify information and explore further

### Story 3: Tone Customization
**As a** capsule creator  
**I want** to define my AI's personality and tone  
**So that** responses match my brand voice

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Implement RAG pipeline: query → retrieval → generation → response
- Use semantic search to find relevant content chunks
- Generate responses using LLM (GPT-4, Claude, or equivalent)
- Include source citations with responses
- Support tone/personality customization (professional, casual, friendly, etc.)
- Handle follow-up questions with conversation context
- Provide "I don't know" responses when content doesn't contain the answer
- Support multi-turn conversations with context retention

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Response latency: < 3 seconds for typical queries
- Retrieval accuracy: Top-3 chunks relevant 90%+ of the time
- Response quality: Factually accurate based on source content
- Concurrent users: Support 100+ simultaneous conversations per capsule
- Token efficiency: Optimize context window usage

## Business Value

High-quality contextual responses create engaging user experiences that keep recipients interacting longer, increasing conversion opportunities and brand perception.

## Dependencies

- Vector database for semantic search (Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant)
- LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or self-hosted)
- Embedding model for query encoding
- Content chunking system

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant content chunks within 1 second
2. WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL cite source documents or sections
3. IF no relevant content exists THEN the system SHALL respond "I don't have information about that"
4. WHEN a follow-up question is asked THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context
5. WHERE tone is configured THEN responses SHALL match the specified personality
6. WHEN multiple relevant chunks exist THEN the system SHALL synthesize information from all sources

## Implementation Notes

### RAG Pipeline Architecture

1. **Query Processing**
   - User question received
   - Query embedding generated
   - Query intent classification (optional)

2. **Retrieval Phase**
   - Semantic search against vector database
   - Retrieve top-K relevant chunks (K=3-5)
   - Re-rank results by relevance score
   - Filter by relevance threshold

3. **Generation Phase**
   - Construct prompt with system instructions, retrieved chunks, and query
   - Apply tone/personality settings
   - Generate response via LLM
   - Extract source citations

4. **Response Delivery**
   - Format response with citations
   - Include confidence indicators
   - Suggest follow-up questions

### Prompt Engineering

**System Prompt Template:**
```
You are an AI assistant for [Capsule Name]. Your role is to answer questions based solely on the provided content. 

Tone: [Professional/Casual/Friendly/etc.]
Personality: [Description]

Rules:
- Only use information from the provided content
- Cite sources when answering
- If information isn't in the content, say so clearly
- Be [tone adjectives]

Content:
[Retrieved chunks]

User Question: [Query]
```

### Response Quality Controls
- Hallucination detection (verify claims against source)
- Relevance scoring (ensure response addresses query)
- Safety filters (prevent harmful content)
- Length optimization (concise but complete)
