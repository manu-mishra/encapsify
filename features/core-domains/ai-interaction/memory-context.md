# Memory & Context Awareness

## Overview

Memory & Context Awareness enables AI capsules to remember previous interactions and maintain conversation continuity across sessions. This feature creates more personalized, coherent experiences by tracking user preferences, questions asked, and conversation history.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Conversation Continuity
**As a** capsule recipient  
**I want** the AI to remember what we discussed earlier in the conversation  
**So that** I don't have to repeat context or questions

### Story 2: Cross-Session Memory
**As a** returning capsule user  
**I want** the AI to remember my previous visits and interests  
**So that** I receive more relevant, personalized responses

### Story 3: Privacy Control
**As a** capsule recipient  
**I want** to clear my conversation history  
**So that** I can maintain privacy and start fresh

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Maintain conversation history within a session (short-term memory)
- Store user interactions across sessions (long-term memory, opt-in)
- Track user preferences and interests
- Reference previous questions and answers in responses
- Support conversation summarization for long interactions
- Provide memory reset/clear functionality
- Respect user privacy preferences (anonymous vs. identified)
- Support conversation export for users

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Memory retrieval latency: < 500ms
- Store up to 50 conversation turns per session
- Long-term memory: Up to 6 months of interaction history
- Privacy compliance: GDPR, CCPA compliant
- Secure storage with encryption
- Memory size limit: 10MB per user

## Business Value

Memory and context awareness create stickier, more valuable interactions that increase return visits and conversion rates. Personalization based on memory improves user satisfaction and reduces friction in multi-step processes.

## Dependencies

- Session management system
- User identification service (optional, for cross-session memory)
- Database for conversation storage
- Privacy consent management
- Data retention policies

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a follow-up question THEN the system SHALL reference previous conversation context
2. WHEN a user returns to a capsule THEN the system SHALL optionally recall previous interactions
3. IF a user requests memory deletion THEN the system SHALL clear all stored conversation data
4. WHEN conversation exceeds 20 turns THEN the system SHALL summarize earlier context
5. WHERE privacy mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL not store long-term memory
6. WHEN referencing memory THEN the system SHALL cite previous conversation turns

## Implementation Notes

### Memory Types

**Short-Term Memory (Session-Based):**
- Current conversation history
- Questions asked in this session
- Topics discussed
- User preferences expressed
- Cleared when session ends (or after timeout)

**Long-Term Memory (Cross-Session):**
- Previous conversation summaries
- Recurring interests or questions
- User profile information (if provided)
- Interaction patterns
- Requires user consent

**Semantic Memory:**
- Key facts user has learned
- Important information highlighted
- User's stated goals or needs
- Preferences (communication style, detail level)

### Memory Architecture

1. **Conversation Storage**
   ```
   Session {
     sessionId: string
     userId: string (optional)
     startTime: timestamp
     turns: [
       {
         role: "user" | "assistant"
         content: string
         timestamp: timestamp
         metadata: object
       }
     ]
     summary: string
   }
   ```

2. **Memory Retrieval**
   - Recent turns: Last 5-10 exchanges
   - Relevant history: Semantic search of past conversations
   - User profile: Stored preferences and patterns

3. **Context Window Management**
   - Prioritize recent context
   - Include relevant historical context
   - Summarize older conversations
   - Stay within LLM token limits

### Privacy & Consent

**Privacy Modes:**
- **Anonymous**: No long-term memory, session-only
- **Identified**: Full memory with user consent
- **Hybrid**: Session memory + anonymized analytics

**User Controls:**
- View conversation history
- Delete specific conversations
- Clear all memory
- Export conversation data
- Opt-out of long-term memory

### Conversation Summarization

For long conversations, generate summaries:
- Key topics discussed
- Questions asked and answered
- User's stated goals or interests
- Action items or next steps
- Important facts or decisions
