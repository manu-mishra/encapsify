# Engagement Metrics

## Overview

Engagement Metrics provides quantitative tracking of capsule performance, including views, interaction duration, conversation depth, and conversion events. This feature gives creators actionable data to measure success and optimize their capsules.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Performance Dashboard
**As a** capsule creator  
**I want** to see how many people viewed and interacted with my capsule  
**So that** I can measure its reach and effectiveness

### Story 2: Conversion Tracking
**As a** sales professional  
**I want** to track how many users clicked my call-to-action  
**So that** I can calculate ROI and optimize my approach

### Story 3: Engagement Trends
**As a** business user  
**I want** to see engagement trends over time  
**So that** I can identify patterns and improve performance

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Track capsule views (unique and total)
- Measure session duration and time-on-capsule
- Count conversation turns per session
- Track CTA clicks and conversions
- Monitor content engagement (which documents/videos accessed)
- Measure drop-off points in conversations
- Track traffic sources and referrers
- Support custom event tracking
- Provide real-time and historical data views
- Enable data export (CSV, PDF reports)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Analytics latency: < 5 minutes for real-time data
- Support 10,000+ events per capsule per day
- Data retention: 12 months minimum
- Dashboard load time: < 2 seconds
- 99.9% tracking accuracy
- GDPR and privacy-compliant tracking

## Business Value

Comprehensive metrics enable data-driven optimization, demonstrating clear ROI and justifying continued investment. Conversion tracking directly ties capsule performance to business outcomes.

## Dependencies

- Analytics tracking infrastructure (e.g., Segment, Mixpanel)
- Data warehouse for historical storage
- Visualization library for dashboards
- Export generation service

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a capsule THEN the system SHALL record the view within 5 minutes
2. WHEN a conversation occurs THEN the system SHALL track duration and turn count
3. IF a CTA is clicked THEN the system SHALL record the conversion event
4. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN metrics SHALL display within 2 seconds
5. WHERE data is exported THEN it SHALL include all selected metrics and date ranges
6. WHEN comparing time periods THEN the system SHALL show percentage changes

## Implementation Notes
