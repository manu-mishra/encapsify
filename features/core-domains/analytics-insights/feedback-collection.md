# Feedback Collection

## Overview

Feedback Collection enables capsule creators to gather direct user feedback through ratings, surveys, and open-ended responses. This feature provides qualitative data to complement analytics, helping creators understand user satisfaction and areas for improvement.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Response Rating
**As a** capsule recipient  
**I want** to rate AI responses as helpful or not  
**So that** the creator knows what's working

### Story 2: NPS Survey
**As a** business user  
**I want** to measure Net Promoter Score from capsule users  
**So that** I can track satisfaction and likelihood to recommend

### Story 3: Custom Feedback Forms
**As a** enterprise user  
**I want** to create custom feedback questions  
**So that** I can gather specific insights relevant to my business

## Technical Requirements

- Implement Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys
- Provide star rating system (1-5 stars)
- Enable custom feedback forms with multiple question types
- Support open-ended text feedback
- Allow feedback at conversation end or specific points
- Aggregate and visualize feedback data
- Send feedback notifications to creators

## Business Value

Direct user feedback provides actionable insights that analytics alone cannot capture, enabling targeted improvements and demonstrating responsiveness to user needs.

## Dependencies

- Survey/form builder infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user rates a response THEN the system SHALL record the rating immediately
2. WHEN a conversation ends THEN the system SHALL optionally prompt for feedback
3. IF NPS is enabled THEN the user SHALL see the standard NPS question
4. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the creator SHALL receive a notification (if configured)
5. WHERE feedback includes text THEN the system SHALL analyze sentiment
6. WHEN viewing feedback THEN the creator SHALL see aggregated scores and individual responses

## Implementation Notes

### Feedback Types

**Response-Level Feedback:**
- Thumbs up/down on individual AI responses
- "Was this helpful?" prompt
- Quick reaction emojis
- Inline feedback without interrupting conversation

**Conversation-Level Feedback:**
- Overall satisfaction rating (1-5 stars)
- NPS question ("How likely are you to recommend?")
- Specific aspect ratings (accuracy, helpfulness, speed)
- Open-ended comments

**Custom Surveys:**
- Multiple choice questions
- Rating scales
- Open-ended text fields
- Conditional logic (show questions based on previous answers)
- Multi-page surveys

### Feedback Triggers

**Automatic Triggers:**
- After conversation ends (configurable delay)
- After N conversation turns

### NPS Implementation

**NPS Question:**

- Detractors (0-6): Negative
- NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
