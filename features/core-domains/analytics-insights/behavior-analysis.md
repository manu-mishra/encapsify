# Behavior Analysis

## Overview

Behavior Analysis provides qualitative insights into how users interact with AI capsules, including common questions, conversation patterns, interest areas, and pain points. This feature helps creators understand user intent and optimize content accordingly.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Question Analysis
**As a** capsule creator  
**I want** to see what questions users ask most frequently  
**So that** I can improve my content to address common needs

### Story 2: Interest Mapping
**As a** real estate agent  
**I want** to know which property features users ask about  
**So that** I can highlight those aspects in my listings

### Story 3: Conversation Patterns
**As a** business user  
**I want** to understand typical user journeys through my capsule  
**So that** I can optimize the conversation flow

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Analyze and categorize user questions
- Identify frequently asked questions (FAQs)
- Track topic interest distribution
- Map conversation flows and patterns
- Identify drop-off points and friction areas
- Detect sentiment in user messages
- Highlight unanswered or poorly answered questions
- Generate conversation insights and recommendations
- Support custom tagging and categorization
- Provide comparative analysis across capsules

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Analysis updates: Daily batch processing
- Support analysis of 100,000+ conversations
- Pattern detection accuracy: 85%+
- Sentiment analysis accuracy: 80%+
- Insights generation time: < 30 seconds

## Business Value

Understanding user behavior enables targeted content improvements, reducing friction and increasing conversion rates. Identifying gaps in content helps creators address unmet needs proactively.

## Dependencies

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) service
- Sentiment analysis engine
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Data visualization tools
- Machine learning models for categorization

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing conversations THEN the system SHALL identify top 10 most asked questions
2. WHEN categorizing questions THEN the system SHALL group similar queries together
3. IF sentiment is negative THEN the system SHALL flag the conversation for review
4. WHEN mapping conversation flows THEN the system SHALL visualize common paths
5. WHERE questions go unanswered THEN the system SHALL highlight content gaps
6. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations

## Implementation Notes

### Analysis Components

**Question Analysis:**
- Extract all user questions from conversations
- Cluster similar questions using semantic similarity
- Rank by frequency and importance
- Identify questions with poor AI responses
- Suggest FAQ additions

**Topic Modeling:**
- Identify main topics discussed
- Track topic distribution over time
- Correlate topics with conversions
- Detect emerging interests
- Map topic relationships

**Conversation Flow Analysis:**
- Visualize common conversation paths
- Identify successful conversion paths
- Detect abandonment points
- Measure conversation depth by path
- Compare flow efficiency

**Sentiment Analysis:**
- Analyze user message sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
- Track sentiment changes during conversation
- Correlate sentiment with outcomes
- Identify frustration triggers
- Measure overall satisfaction

### Insights Dashboard

**Questions Tab:**
- Top questions list with frequency
- Question categories and distribution
- Unanswered questions report
- Question trends over time
- Suggested content improvements

**Topics Tab:**
- Topic cloud visualization
- Topic interest heatmap
- Topic correlation with conversions
- Emerging topics alert
- Topic coverage gaps

**Flows Tab:**
- Conversation flow diagram
- Path success rates
- Drop-off analysis
- Average path length
- Optimization recommendations

**Sentiment Tab:**
- Overall sentiment score
- Sentiment distribution
- Sentiment trends
- Negative sentiment triggers
- Satisfaction correlation

### Machine Learning Models

**Question Clustering:**
- Use sentence embeddings (BERT, Sentence-BERT)
- Apply clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN)
- Continuously refine clusters with new data

**Topic Modeling:**
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- Dynamic topic modeling for trends

**Sentiment Classification:**
- Pre-trained sentiment models
- Fine-tuned on conversational data
- Multi-class classification (positive, neutral, negative, frustrated)

### Actionable Recommendations

System generates recommendations such as:
- "Add FAQ about [topic] - asked 50 times this week"
- "Users asking about [feature] often convert - highlight it more"
- "30% of users drop off when asking about [topic] - improve content"
- "Negative sentiment detected around [issue] - address in content"
- "Users interested in [topic] rarely find answers - add content"
