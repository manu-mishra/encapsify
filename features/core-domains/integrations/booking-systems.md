# Booking Systems Integration

## Overview

Booking Systems Integration enables users to schedule appointments, calls, or meetings directly from AI capsules. This feature embeds scheduling functionality into the conversation flow, reducing friction and increasing conversion from interest to booked appointment.

## User Stories

**So that** prospects can book times that work for both of us

### Story 3: Automated Reminders
**As a** service provider  
**I want** automatic booking confirmations and reminders sent  
**So that** I reduce no-shows and administrative work
