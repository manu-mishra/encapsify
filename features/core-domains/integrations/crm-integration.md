# CRM Integration

## Overview

CRM Integration enables automatic synchronization of capsule interactions, lead captures, and engagement data with customer relationship management systems. This feature eliminates manual data entry and ensures sales teams have complete visibility into prospect interactions.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Automatic Lead Capture
**As a** sales professional  
**I want** capsule interactions to automatically create leads in my CRM  
**So that** I don't have to manually enter prospect information

### Story 2: Engagement Tracking
**As a** sales manager  
**I want** to see capsule engagement data in our CRM  
**So that** my team can prioritize hot leads

### Story 3: Bi-Directional Sync
**As a** enterprise user  
**I want** CRM contact updates to reflect in capsule personalization  
**So that** interactions are always current and relevant

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Support major CRM platforms (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho)
- Automatically create/update contacts from capsule interactions
- Sync engagement data (views, questions, conversions) to CRM
- Map capsule fields to CRM fields
- Support custom field mapping
- Enable bi-directional synchronization
- Provide real-time and batch sync options
- Support lead scoring based on capsule engagement
- Enable workflow triggers in CRM based on capsule events
- Provide sync status dashboard and error handling

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Sync latency: < 5 minutes for real-time mode
- Support 10,000+ contacts per account
- 99.5% sync reliability
- Handle CRM API rate limits gracefully
- Secure credential storage (OAuth 2.0)

## Business Value

CRM integration streamlines sales processes, improves lead quality through engagement data, and increases conversion rates by enabling timely, informed follow-ups.

## Dependencies

- OAuth 2.0 authentication service
- CRM API connectors (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- Data mapping engine
- Sync queue and retry logic
- Webhook infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects a CRM THEN the system SHALL authenticate via OAuth
2. WHEN a capsule interaction occurs THEN contact data SHALL sync to CRM within 5 minutes
3. IF a contact exists in CRM THEN the system SHALL update rather than duplicate
4. WHEN field mapping is configured THEN data SHALL map correctly to CRM fields
5. WHERE sync errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry and notify the user
6. WHEN viewing sync status THEN the user SHALL see last sync time and any errors

### Data Synchronization

**Contact/Lead Creation:**
```
Capsule Data → CRM Fields
- Name → First Name, Last Name
- Email → Email
- Phone → Phone
- Company → Company Name
- Custom fields → Custom CRM fields
```

**Engagement Data:**
```
Capsule Events → CRM Activity
- Capsule view → Activity log
- Questions asked → Notes/Comments
- Time spent → Custom field
- Content accessed → Activity log
- Conversion events → Opportunity/Deal
```

**Lead Scoring:**
```
Engagement Metrics → Lead Score
- Capsule views: +5 points
- Questions asked: +10 points per question
- Time spent > 5 min: +15 points
- Content downloaded: +20 points
- CTA clicked: +30 points
```

### Field Mapping Interface

**Mapping Configuration:**
1. Select CRM platform
2. Authenticate connection
3. View available CRM fields
4. Map capsule fields to CRM fields
5. Set default values for unmapped fields
6. Configure sync direction (one-way or bi-directional)
7. Test mapping with sample data
8. Activate sync

**Standard Mappings:**
- Pre-configured for common fields
- Industry-specific templates
- Custom mapping for unique needs

### Sync Modes

**Real-Time Sync:**
- Immediate sync on capsule events
- Uses webhooks for instant updates
- Best for high-value leads

**Batch Sync:**
- Scheduled sync (hourly, daily)
- Efficient for high-volume
- Reduces API calls

**Manual Sync:**
- On-demand synchronization
- Useful for testing
- Selective sync of specific records

### CRM Workflow Triggers

**Capsule Events That Trigger CRM Workflows:**
- New capsule view
- High engagement detected (time > threshold)
- Specific question asked
- CTA clicked
- Negative sentiment detected
- Capsule completed

**Example Workflows:**
- Send follow-up email after capsule view
- Assign lead to sales rep after high engagement
- Create task for sales rep after CTA click
- Notify manager of hot lead
- Add to nurture campaign if low engagement

### Bi-Directional Sync

**CRM → Capsule:**
- Contact updates reflect in capsule personalization
- Deal stage changes trigger capsule content updates
- Custom field values used in AI responses
- Contact preferences applied to capsule behavior

**Capsule → CRM:**
- Engagement data updates contact records
- Lead scores updated based on activity
- Conversation summaries added to notes
- Conversion events create opportunities

### Error Handling

**Common Errors:**
- Authentication expired → Re-authenticate
- Rate limit exceeded → Queue and retry
- Field mapping error → Notify user, skip record
- Duplicate detection → Update existing record
- Invalid data → Validate and sanitize

**Error Dashboard:**
- List of failed syncs
- Error descriptions
- Retry options
- Bulk resolution tools

### Security & Privacy

**Data Protection:**
- OAuth 2.0 for authentication
- Encrypted credential storage
- Minimal data transfer (only necessary fields)
- GDPR-compliant data handling

**Access Control:**
- Role-based CRM permissions respected
- Audit log of sync activities
- User consent for data sharing
