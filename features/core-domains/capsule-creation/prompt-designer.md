# Smart Prompt Designer

## Overview

Smart Prompt Designer enables users to configure AI behavior, personality, and response style without writing complex prompts. Through an intuitive interface, users can define tone, verbosity, call-to-action preferences, and conversation guardrails.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Personality Configuration
**As a** capsule creator  
**I want** to set my AI's personality (professional, friendly, enthusiastic)  
**So that** responses match my brand voice

### Story 2: Response Guidelines
**As a** business user  
**I want** to define what topics the AI should avoid  
**So that** conversations stay on-brand and appropriate

### Story 3: CTA Integration
**As a** sales professional  
**I want** the AI to naturally guide users toward booking a call  
**So that** I generate more qualified leads

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Provide personality presets (professional, casual, friendly, enthusiastic, etc.)
- Allow custom tone descriptions
- Configure response length (concise, balanced, detailed)
- Set conversation goals (inform, convert, qualify, educate)
- Define topic boundaries (allowed/restricted subjects)
- Configure call-to-action behavior and timing
- Set greeting and farewell messages
- Enable/disable specific capabilities (memory, follow-ups, etc.)
- Provide prompt preview and testing interface

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Prompt changes apply immediately to new conversations
- Support A/B testing of different prompt configurations
- Maintain prompt version history
- Validate prompt effectiveness with quality metrics

## Business Value

Easy AI configuration empowers non-technical users to create effective capsules, reducing dependency on prompt engineering expertise and accelerating time-to-value.

## Dependencies

- LLM prompt engineering framework
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Analytics for prompt performance
- Template library for common scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a personality preset THEN the AI SHALL respond in that style
2. WHEN response length is set to "concise" THEN answers SHALL be under 100 words
3. IF restricted topics are defined THEN the AI SHALL decline to discuss them
4. WHEN a CTA is configured THEN the AI SHALL naturally suggest it at appropriate times
5. WHERE custom instructions are provided THEN they SHALL override default behavior
6. WHEN testing prompts THEN the user SHALL see sample responses
