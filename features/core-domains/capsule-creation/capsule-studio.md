# Capsule Studio

## Overview

Capsule Studio is the visual builder interface for creating and configuring AI capsules. It provides a drag-and-drop, no-code environment where users can assemble content, configure AI behavior, customize branding, and preview their capsule before publishing.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Quick Capsule Creation
**As a** new user  
**I want** to create my first capsule in under 10 minutes  
**So that** I can quickly test the platform's value

### Story 2: Template-Based Start
**As a** real estate agent  
**I want** to start from a property listing template  
**So that** I don't have to build everything from scratch

### Story 3: Live Preview
**As a** capsule creator  
**I want** to see changes in real-time as I build  
**So that** I can iterate quickly and ensure quality
