# Multimodal Input

## Overview

Multimodal Input enables users to upload and integrate diverse content types into their AI capsules, including documents, videos, images, audio files, and web links. This feature provides a unified interface for content ingestion regardless of format.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Document Upload
**As a** business user  
**I want** to upload PDFs, Word documents, and presentations  
**So that** my AI capsule can answer questions based on my existing materials

### Story 2: Video Integration
**As a** real estate agent  
**I want** to upload property walkthrough videos  
**So that** prospects can ask questions about specific features shown in the video

### Story 3: Link-Based Content
**As a** content creator  
**I want** to add URLs to my website or blog posts  
**So that** my capsule can reference my online content without manual copying

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Support file uploads for: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, MD
- Support video formats: MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM
- Support image formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Support audio formats: MP3, WAV, M4A
- Accept and crawl web URLs for content extraction
- Provide drag-and-drop upload interface
- Support batch uploads (multiple files simultaneously)
- Display upload progress and status
- Validate file types and sizes before processing

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Maximum file size: 500MB per file (configurable by tier)
- Upload processing time: < 30 seconds for documents, < 2 minutes for videos
- Support concurrent uploads (up to 10 files)
- Secure file storage with encryption at rest
- Content virus scanning before acceptance

## Business Value

Multimodal input reduces friction in capsule creation, allowing users to leverage existing content assets. This accelerates time-to-value and increases capsule richness, leading to higher engagement rates.

## Dependencies

- Cloud storage service (S3 or equivalent)
- Content extraction libraries (PDF parsing, video transcription)
- Web scraping service for URL content
- Virus scanning service

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF THEN the system SHALL extract text content within 30 seconds
2. WHEN a user uploads a video THEN the system SHALL generate a transcript and extract key frames
3. WHEN a user provides a URL THEN the system SHALL crawl and extract relevant content
4. IF a file exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
5. WHEN multiple files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process them in parallel
6. IF a file contains malware THEN the system SHALL reject it and notify the user

## Implementation Notes

### Content Extraction Pipeline
1. File validation and virus scanning
2. Format-specific extraction (text, transcription, metadata)
3. Content normalization and cleaning
4. Storage in content repository
5. Indexing for AI training

### Supported Content Sources
- Direct file upload via web interface
- Drag-and-drop interface
- URL/link submission
- Future: Cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox)
