# Live Sync

## Overview

Live Sync enables real-time synchronization between AI capsules and external content sources like Google Drive, Notion, Dropbox, and websites. This feature ensures capsules always reflect the latest information without manual re-uploads.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Google Drive Integration
**As a** business user  
**I want** my capsule to automatically update when I modify documents in Google Drive  
**So that** my AI always provides current information without manual intervention

### Story 2: Website Content Sync
**As a** sales professional  
**I want** my capsule to sync with my product website  
**So that** pricing and feature updates are automatically reflected

### Story 3: Notion Database Sync
**As a** team lead  
**I want** my capsule to pull from our Notion knowledge base  
**So that** team documentation changes are immediately available

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Support OAuth integration with Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive
- Support webhook-based updates from Notion, Confluence
- Support scheduled polling for website content changes
- Detect content changes and trigger re-processing
- Provide sync status dashboard (last sync, next sync, errors)
- Allow selective sync (specific folders or files)
- Support sync frequency configuration (real-time, hourly, daily)
- Maintain sync history and change logs

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Sync latency: < 5 minutes for webhook-based sources
- Polling frequency: Configurable from 15 minutes to 24 hours
- Support up to 50 synced sources per capsule (Enterprise tier)
- Handle rate limits from external services gracefully
- Retry failed syncs with exponential backoff
- 99.5% sync reliability

## Business Value

Live Sync eliminates manual content maintenance, reducing operational overhead and ensuring information accuracy. This is critical for business users with frequently updated content, improving trust and reducing support burden.

## Dependencies

- OAuth 2.0 authentication service
- Webhook receiver infrastructure
- Content change detection service
- Integration APIs for each supported platform
- Queue system for sync job management

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects Google Drive THEN the system SHALL authenticate via OAuth and list available files
2. WHEN a synced document changes THEN the system SHALL detect the change within 5 minutes
3. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL re-process and update the capsule automatically
4. IF a sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times and notify the user
5. WHEN viewing sync status THEN the user SHALL see last sync time and any errors
6. WHERE rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL queue updates and process when available

## Implementation Notes

### Supported Integration Types

**Cloud Storage (OAuth-based):**
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Microsoft OneDrive
- Box

**Knowledge Bases (Webhook/API):**
- Notion
- Confluence
- Coda

**Web Content (Polling):**
- Website URLs
- RSS feeds
- API endpoints

### Sync Architecture

1. **Connection Setup**: User authorizes integration via OAuth or API key
2. **Initial Sync**: Full content import and processing
3. **Change Detection**: 
   - Webhooks for real-time updates (Notion, Drive)
   - Polling for periodic checks (websites)
4. **Incremental Update**: Only changed content is re-processed
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Latest version wins, with change history

### Sync Configuration Options
- Sync frequency (real-time, hourly, daily, manual)
- Selective sync (specific folders, files, or pages)
- Sync direction (one-way from source to capsule)
- Notification preferences (email on sync errors)
