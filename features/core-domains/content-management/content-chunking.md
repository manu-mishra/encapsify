# Content Chunking Engine

## Overview

The Content Chunking Engine intelligently segments uploaded content into digestible blocks optimized for AI training and retrieval. This feature ensures that AI responses are accurate, contextual, and efficiently generated from large content sources.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Automatic Document Segmentation
**As a** business user  
**I want** my uploaded documents automatically broken into logical sections  
**So that** the AI can provide precise answers without overwhelming context

### Story 2: Video Timestamp Chunking
**As a** course creator  
**I want** my videos segmented by topic or timestamp  
**So that** users can jump to relevant sections when asking questions

### Story 3: Semantic Chunking
**As a** enterprise user  
**I want** content chunked by meaning rather than arbitrary size  
**So that** AI responses maintain coherent context

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Automatically segment text documents by paragraphs, sections, or semantic boundaries
- Chunk video content by scene changes, timestamps, or transcript segments
- Maintain metadata for each chunk (source, position, timestamp)
- Support configurable chunk sizes (token limits)
- Preserve context overlap between chunks for continuity
- Generate embeddings for each chunk for semantic search
- Support re-chunking when content is updated

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Chunking processing time: < 1 minute per 10,000 words
- Chunk size optimization: 500-2000 tokens per chunk
- Embedding generation: < 5 seconds per chunk
- Support up to 10,000 chunks per capsule
- Maintain chunk relationships and hierarchy

## Business Value

Intelligent chunking improves AI response quality and speed, leading to better user experiences and higher capsule engagement. It enables handling of large content libraries without performance degradation.

## Dependencies

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) library for semantic analysis
- Embedding model (OpenAI, Cohere, or custom)
- Vector database for chunk storage and retrieval
- Content Management system for source tracking

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL chunk it into semantic segments
2. WHEN a video is processed THEN the system SHALL create chunks aligned with transcript segments
3. WHEN chunks are created THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for semantic search
4. IF content is updated THEN the system SHALL re-chunk affected sections only
5. WHEN retrieving content THEN the system SHALL return relevant chunks with source references
6. WHERE chunk boundaries occur THEN the system SHALL maintain context overlap of 10-20%

## Implementation Notes

### Chunking Strategies

**Text Documents:**
- Paragraph-based chunking for general content
- Section-based chunking for structured documents
- Semantic chunking using NLP for complex materials
- Maintain heading hierarchy and document structure

**Video Content:**
- Transcript-based segmentation
- Scene change detection for visual chunking
- Speaker change detection for interviews
- Timestamp preservation for user navigation

**Audio Content:**
- Transcript-based chunking similar to video
- Silence detection for natural boundaries
- Topic modeling for semantic segments

### Chunk Metadata
Each chunk includes:
- Source document/file ID
- Position in original content
- Timestamp (for video/audio)
- Heading/section context
- Token count
- Embedding vector
- Related chunks (previous/next)
