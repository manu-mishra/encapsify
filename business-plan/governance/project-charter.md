## Business Case

### Problem Statement
Businesses and creators struggle to engage audiences with static content in an increasingly noisy digital landscape. Traditional content formats (documents, videos, websites) lack interactivity, personalization, and intelligence. Existing tools either focus on one-way communication (video tools) or lack visual engagement (chatbots).

### Opportunity
The convergence of AI, conversational interfaces, and content marketing creates a $50B+ market opportunity for interactive, intelligent content experiences. Encaptio/Encapsify addresses this gap by enabling anyone to create AI-powered capsules that combine multimodal content with conversational intelligence.

### Strategic Alignment
This project aligns with the following strategic objectives:
- Create a new category in the AI and content marketing space
- Build a scalable SaaS platform with strong unit economics
- Establish market leadership in target verticals (real estate, automotive, sales, education)
